# DrumKit
The Drum Kit is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allowing for easy accessibility across different devices and browsers. It features a visually appealing interface with interactive drum pads representing various drum sounds. Simply click or tap on the drum pads, and you'll hear the corresponding sound as if you were playing a real drum set.
